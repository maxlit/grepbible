# grepbible

`grepbible` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to make searching for Bible verses (in ca. 60 languages) locally (like grepping) and looking up the Bible quotes fast and intuitive.  
It also represents a new channel for Bible distribution and aids in language learning, as parallel Bible translations have been used for centuries to learn languages.

The raw text is taken from [Wordproject®](https://www.wordproject.org), and has undergone processing to fit the specific needs and format of this project.

## Features

- **Search Capabilities**: Look up individual verses, ranges of chapters, or specific passages across multiple translations.
- **Multiple Bible Versions**: Easily switch between different Bible translations to compare interpretations and wording.
- **Local Caching**: Bible versions are downloaded and stored locally for quick access and offline use.
- **Parallel and interleave text**: Combine text blocks from different translations.

## Installation

To install `grepbible`, ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system. You can install `grepbible` directly from PyPI:

```sh
pip install grepbible
```

This command installs the `grepbible` package and makes the `gbib` command available in your shell.

You might need to update your `PATH` as well (e.g. on Ubuntu):

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin
```
and add it to `~/.bashrc` to make it persistent

## Usage

`grepbible` is designed to be straightforward and easy to use from the command line. The default version (unless the flag `-v` is specified) is 'kj' ([KJV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version)), in English.

Below are some common usage examples:

### Look Up a Single Verse

```sh
gbib -c "John 3:11"
```

```
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
```

### Compare Verses in Different Translations

```sh
gbib -v kj,pl -c "Romans 8:20"
```

```
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

Gdyż stworzenie marności jest poddane, nie dobrowolnie, ale dla tego, który je poddał,
```

### Lookup a Chapter

```sh
gbib -c 'Psalms 117'
```

```
O Praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.
```

### Show a Range of Verses

```sh
gbib -c "Gen 41:29-30"
```

```
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
```

### Fetch Multiple Disjoint Verses

```sh
gbib -c "Genesis 1:1,3"
```

### Compare different versions

Show interleave translation of Latin Vulgata to English KJV (line-by-line):
```sh
gbib -c 'Gen 41:29-30' -v kj,vg -i
```

Block-by block translation (omit the flag `-i`):

```sh
 gbib -c 'Gen 41:29-30' -v kj,vg 
```

```
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

ecce septem anni venient fertilitatis magnae in universa terra Aegypti
quos sequentur septem anni alii tantae sterilitatis ut oblivioni tradatur cuncta retro abundantia consumptura est enim fames omnem terram
```

For more information on command options and additional features, you can run:

```sh
gbib --help
```

### Use with grep

One can literally use `grep` to look up the verses and leverage `gbib` only for downloading the sources. Here's how.

First, download KJV ('kj') and Vulgata ('vg'). The data is stored in `$HOME/grepbible_data`, thus, it makes sense to store it as a variable, e.g. the path to the 5th chapter of Exodus in KJV will be $HOME/grepbible_data/kj/Exodus/5.txt

```sh
gbib -d kj,vg
export GB=$HOME/grepbible_data/kj
```

#### Go to line

Example, jump 10th line of 5th chapter in Exodus:
```sh
less +10 $GB/Exodus/5.txt
```

#### Count occurences of words

How often the word 'camel' appears in the Bible:
```sh
grep -nr $GB -e camel | wc -l # 59
```

#### What was this quote about the sheep and wolves?

```sh
grep -nr $GB -e wolves | grep sheep
```
